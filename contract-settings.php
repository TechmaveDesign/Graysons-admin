<p>NON-SECURED </p>

<p> TENANCY AGREEMENT</p>

<p>(Student Accommodation)</p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PROSPECTIVE OCCUPANTS</p>

<p>THIS IS A NON-SECURE TENANCY AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUNDERLAND CITY COUNCIL ‘THE LANDLORD' AND YOU ‘THE TENANT(S)'. ONCE SIGNED AND COMPLETED THE AGREEMENT BECOMES A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD. TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS TENANCY AGREEMENT IS A BINDING DOCUMENT. BEFORE SIGNING IT, YOU SHOULD READ IT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING YOU WANT INCLUDED AND NOTHING THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU. </p>

<p>IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT OR ANYTHING IN IT, BEFORE YOU SIGN IT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER TAKING ADVICE FROM A SOLICITOR, CITIZENS ADVICE, OR A HOUSING ADVICE CENTRE.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>This Tenancy Agreement is a legal contract that describes the rights and responsibilities of Sunderland City Council, "the Landlord" (referred to throughout this Tenancy Agreement as "the Council" and of you, "the Tenant.") </p>

<p>This Tenancy Agreement is granted to you in accordance with Paragraphs 3 and 10 of Schedule 1 of the Housing Act 1985. This tenancy is not a secure tenancy, and the tenancy will not become secure unless the Council notifies you, in writing, that this tenancy is a secure tenancy. </p>

<p>This Non-Secure Tenancy Agreement is the document you sign when you become a Tenant of Sunderland City Council, (the "Council"). It is a legally binding contract between you and the Council and records information such as your name, the date your tenancy commenced and the initial rent.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT CLAUSE SUMMARY</p>

<p>Check-in - (Please Note that we require minimum of 2 weeks' notice to book in a move in. Check-ins are undertaken during working hours (weekdays from 12pm to 6.00pm and Saturdays 10.00am to 2.00pm excluding bank holidays and Sundays) </p>

<p>Check- out - The Tenant will arrange for the Council / or the Managing Agent to attend at the Property by reasonable notice prior to expiry of the Term to carry out a check-out inspection (minimum 2 weeks' notice is required).  The Checkout must be undertaken between Monday to Saturday before 12 pm excluding bank holidays and Sundays.</p>

<p>Rent - The Tenant shall pay the Rent in advance by standing order to the account nominated by the Council's Managing Agent for such purposes on the 23rd day of each month, starting from the 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2024, over 10 instalments. </p>

<p>Additional appliances and furniture -The Tenant shall not keep in the Property any stove, heater or lamp burning paraffin (or any other type of fuel or oil) not use or permit to be used, any handheld or moveable electrical appliance which has not proved to be maintained in good order to prevent danger. Such maintenance (PAT testing) of personal equipment is to be carried out at the expense of the tenant. Where such equipment is under 12 months old, and the Tenant can provide the Council or the Managing Agent the receipt of purchase, it will be exempt from such testing. Appliances included, but not limited to: kitchen cooking appliances, desktop personal computers, gaming consoles, irons and mini fridges. The Council's permission is required before any additional furniture or electrical appliances are brought into the property, for which additional charges may apply.</p>

<p>Council tax - Liability for the Council Tax for the tenancy is the ultimate responsibility of the Tenant. Whilst full time students are exempt from council tax, part time students and professionals are not. Should a bill become payable for any duration during the tenancy (no longer student), it is the responsibility of the Tenant to pay the amount owed to the Council or the Managing Agent.  </p>

<p>Overnight guests - Additional Guests are allowed overnight for short stays of no more than one week. Additional charges may apply for longer stays. Prior permission is required by raising an issue on Graysons properties App. This is important for health &amp; safety, security, and insurance purposes.</p>

<p>Disclaimer. As a prospective tenant, you have been given the opportunity to view the property and ask any questions prior to signing the Tenancy Agreement.
